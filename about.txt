The algorithms:
	1. Select 3 point to be the vertexes of the triangle
	2. Draw a point at a random position
	3. Choose one of the 3 vertexes and draw a point halfway between it and the point drawn at step 2.
	4. Choose one of the 3 vertexes and draw a point halfway between it and the point drawn at step 3.
	5. Repeat step 4.
